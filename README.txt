So, it should work if you download the respository and also

https://www.dropbox.com/s/jx5u3nhd6tkwdvy/BigFiles.zip?dl=0

and then put the res folders in their appropriate places
and I also put a jar, put that in the like "root" directory.

The main help that I can provide you is in the form of the IqaluFinder project, you might want to just keep that and redo the Android app.. (but you can use mine for reference)

The two functions in IqaluFinder are a) associating id's to regions on the map, and b) it has a way to split up the map into smaller pieces.

Hope this helps, let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
